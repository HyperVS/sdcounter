Each command's file name needs to be the name of the command... e.g help.js is for the help command
The following is what each command needs to export for the command handler to work:

module.exports = {
    name: 'command-name',
    aliases: ['command', 'aliases', 'leave as empty array if no aliases']
    args: 1, 
    usage: 'string indicating how the command is supposed to be used',
    execute(client, message, args){
        // Add your code here
    }
}
