# discord.js-template-project
A template for discord.js aimed at getting you started with Discord bot development as quick as possible.

## Installation and getting started

Fork or clone the repository then use the package manager npm to install dependancies.

```bash
npm install
```

Then copy the contents of .env.example into a .env file and add your Discord bot token.

## Usage

Run the bot for the first time.

```bash
npm run dev
```
Any changes made will restart the bot as we are using nodemon. Happy coding!

## Notes

All events are to be added to the events folder and all commands are to be added to the commands folder.

The prefix of the bot, color of embeds, and footer message can all be changed in config.json.
